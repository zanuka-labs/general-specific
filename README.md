generic item list/detail app

The list/detail functionality is something often built from scratch, so I thought it would be handy to arrive on a generic setup or starting point to be used for future React/Redux apps. Or it might just evolve into something else :alien:

## basics
- generic item list viewer
- components built with React
- state managed by Redux

## goals
- save some time by having a generic list/detail module to extend
- possibly wrap the functionality into an npm module and publish
- consider creating a parent CLI for stuff like this (react/redux starters, etc...)

## inspiration
This project is inspired by the book list example from [Stephen Grider's](https://github.com/StephenGrider) excellent course on Udemy, [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux). If you aren't able to view the course, I recommend his companion code at [ReduxCasts](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxCasts).
