react/redux app config with generic item list

**upgrade branch coming soon** - experimenting with updated config on [that-app-config-i-want](https://github.com/zanuka/general-specific/tree/that-app-config-i-want) branch

The list functionality is something often built from scratch, so I thought it would be handy to arrive on a generic setup or starting point to be used for future apps. Or it might just evolve into something else :alien:

## basics
- generic item list viewer
- components built with React
- state managed by Redux

## goals
- save some time by having a generic list/detail module to extend
- possibly wrap the functionality into an npm module and publish
- consider creating a parent CLI for stuff like this (react/redux starters, etc...)

## roadmap
  - see [issues](https://github.com/zanuka-labs/general-specific/issues)
